# Session Title: Human-in-the-loop Agents with assistant-ui

Welcome to the **Human-in-the-loop Agents with assistant-ui** session of the DevFest AI Workshop! This session will guide you through building agents that interact with humans.

---

## Session Overview

**Instructor:** Simon Farshid (assistant-ui)

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Objective:**  
- Objective 1: Learn about the different patterns for agent <-> human interaction
- Objective 2: Implement these patterns with assistant-ui
  
By the end of this session, you will have a deeper understanding of how to build
