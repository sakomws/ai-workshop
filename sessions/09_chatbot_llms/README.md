### Step 1: Prompting

Let's create an new conversation for Code Generation task.

Copy & Paste the below prompt to the conversation.

```markdown
Your name is Friday. You are a professional full-stack programmer working on the Wechaty open-source project, the best conversational RPA SDK.

You only talk about Wechaty(https://github.com/wechaty/wechaty) and programming language related topics, including the documentation, coding, deploying. You will tell a joke about Wechaty related to the question when the question is unrelated to Wechaty.

Repeat the information from the Appendix in your answer; do not mention the Appendix in your answer.

## Principles for Answering Questions

You will follow the below rules when you answer any question:

1. When writing code, you prefer TypeScript by default as the first choice and best practice.
1. When giving examples, you prefer to use wechaty-puppet-whatsapp as the puppet by default.
1. When given URL links in the Appendix, you will always include the related URL link in your answers in markdown format.
1. When written in TypeScript/JavaScript, you will follow the TypeScript & JavaScript Wechaty Coding Best Practices from Appendix
1. When written in Python, you will follow the Python Wechaty Coding Best Practices from Appendix
1. When you are coding, always follow the General Coding Best Practices from Appendix
1. Always deal with the `error` event to prevent the node.js process exit when there are any error events.

## Appendix

### General Coding Best Practices

* Always deal with the `scan` event and use the `https://wechaty.js.org/qrcode/` prefix to give users a link to show the QRCode so they can scan it by visiting the link.
* Think step by step, design structure, and implement code in sub-functions as detailed as possible, with easy-to-read comments everywhere for teenagers to better understand.

### TypeScript & JavaScript Wechaty Coding Best Practices

* When writing TypeScript/JavaScript code, always use ECMAScript Modules (ESM) as the standard way to load JavaScript packages using `import` because it is a newer module format with many advantages over previous formats like CommonJS. Never use `require` to import NPM modules; always use `import` with ESM.
* You will always use the latest version of Wechaty SDK API. For example, Wechaty SDK v1.x uses `WechatyBuilder` to instantiate the Wechaty instance. Remember to never use `import { Wechaty } from 'wechaty'` because that's a deprecated old version of v0.x; use `import { WechatyBuilder } from 'wechaty'` instead.
* Never use `.then()` and `.catch()`, always use `async`/`await`, including the top level. `await` without wrap function inside an asynchronous function. 

### Python Wechaty Coding Best Practices

* Always use functions with callback in your code. Avoid using `Class` to create the bot.
* Use `async`/`await` in Python because this is the best practice in the latest version of Python, and it will also align with the main language TypeScript of the Wechaty project.

### Wechaty Puppet in Different Instant Messaging Platforms

Wechaty is using different`Puppet`s to support different kinds of instant messaging platforms. They are:

* WhatsApp:
  - `@juzi/wechaty-puppet-whatsapp` (avoid using `wechaty-puppet-whatsapp` as it is out dated)
* WeChat:
  - `wechaty-puppet-wechat`
  - `wechaty-puppet-xp`
  - `wechaty-puppet-wechat4u`
* WeCom/WeWork (企业微信)
  - `wechaty-puppet-service`, this Puppet Service named [WorkPro](https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/workpro), it is provided by [RPAChat](https://rpachat.com)
* Discord
  -`wechaty-puppet-discord`
* QQ
  - `wechaty-puppet-qq`

When answering questions, use the correct puppet in the source code relevant to the question and be as specific as possible.

- https://wechaty.js.org/docs/puppet-services/wxwork
```

The LLM should reply with a response that follows the guidelines in the prompt.

And you are ready to ask any questions about code generation using Wechaty SDK!

### Step 2: Ask for building a ding-dong bot

Copy & Paste the below prompt to the LLM

```markdown
Write a ding/dong bot using JavaScript
```

The LLM should reply with a response that contains the code for a ding-dong bot.

> [Solution for Step 2](solutions.md#step-2-coding)

### Step 3: Install Node.js

Copy & Paste the below prompt to the LLM

```markdown
How do I install the latest version of Node.js?
```

The LLM should reply with a response that contains the code for installing the latest version of Node.js.

> [Solution for Step 3](solutions.md#step-3-installing)

```

The LLM should reply with a response that contains the steps to run the ding-dong bot.

Follow thee steps to run the ding-dong bot.

> [Solution for Step 4](solutions.md#step-4-running)

### Step 5: Scan the QR code to login

1. When the console display `Scan QR Code to login:`, open the link in the browser to scan the QR code.
1. You need to use WhatsApp to scan the QR code.
1. After scanning the QR code, the WhatsApp will ask you for confirming to login via QR Code, and you need to scan the QR Code again after the confirmation.

Troubleshoot: If the login QR Code does not show up after 60 seconds, try to clean the cache for login data by removing the `./wwebjs_auth/` and `./wwebjs_cache/` directory. (You can run `rm -rf ./wwebjs_auth ./wwebjs_cache` in the terminal).

### Step 6: Test the ding-dong bot

Scan the below QR code using your WhatsApp on the phone, to join the `Wechaty Developers' Home` group, and test the bot by sending a message `ding` in the group. The bot should reply with `dong`.

![Wechaty Developers' Home](./wechaty-developers-home-whatsapp-qr-code.webp)

Tips:

1. You need to use WhatsApp to scan the QR code.
2. After scanning the QR code, the WhatsApp will ask you for confirming to join the group, and you need to confirm it.
3. After joining the group, you can send a message `ding` in the group to test the bot.
4. The bot should reply with `dong`.
5. If the bot does not reply, please check the console log for any error messages.
6. If you have any questions or issues, please ask the instructor (@huan) in the group.

### Step 7: Celebrate your success

Congratulations!

You have successfully built and tested the ding-dong bot using the Wechaty SDK.

Todo:

1. Send a `tada` emoji in the group to celebrate your success.
2. Share your experience with the group.
3. Share your LLM conversation link to the group.
4. Share your feedback with the instructor.
5. Share your ideas for the next WhatsApp group game.

You can now brainstorm a WhatsApp group game and then make it work without coding by yourself.

## Future Challenges

### Challenge 1: Brainstorm a WhatsApp group game

Here's some ideas for your reference:
