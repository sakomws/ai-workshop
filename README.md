This led to the desire to bring these superpowers to the rest of the world; hence contributing to Nix as a maintainer and founding Flox.

#### Session
- **Title**: Flox: Rethinking How We Build & Collab
- **Description**: In this session, we'll introduce you to [Flox](https://flox.dev).
  Flox is an open-source (GPL2) tool for simple and powerful system dependency mangement,
  per-project, and decoupled from your machine.  
  Underneath, we are using [Nix](https://nixos.org) which gives us access to 
  [over 100,000 packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages).  
  Many of these packages are cross-platform and built natively for your machine
  whether you are using a Macbook or a Linux server in Google Cloud.
  Flox is designed to be simple to teach to your teammates so you can immediately
  be productive together without taking much time to learn Nix concepts.
  We'll start with the basics and try some Local AI development.
